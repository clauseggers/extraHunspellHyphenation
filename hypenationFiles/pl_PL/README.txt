The first version of the patterns was developed by Hanna Kołodziejska (1987). The adaptation to the LeX format (see below) and extensive modification were done by Bogusław Jackowski & Marek Ryćko (1987–1989). The hyphenation rules were further improved and adapted to the TeX 3.x requirements by Hanna Kołodziejska (1991). Lone-standing version (3.0a) of patterns was prepared (under pressure from LaTeX users) by Bogusław Jackowski and Marek Ryćko, following Mariusz Olko’s suggestions, 1995.
