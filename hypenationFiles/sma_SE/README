 Installation
 ============
 
 On Linux
 ------
 
 As an administrator user
 make install
 
 This will install the speller files in the appropriate places, and add support
 for Northern S치mi. Hunspell and enchant based spellers are then able to use it.
 This includes OpenOffice.org, version 2.4 and above and KDE4.
  
 Known issues
 ============
 
 - speed:
   The generated lexicon file are huge. It is quite
   comprehensive, but it makes Hunspell slow. We have tried to speed up the
   dictionaries by using alias compression, but the startup time is still 
   noticable even on 2.33 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo machines.
   
 - Compounding
   Quite a few compounding patterns aren't recognized.
