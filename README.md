# Extra hyphenation files for the Suite of MacOS Affinity applications*
\* and other MacOS applications that make use of `Hunspell` dictionaries.

*Hunspell is based in principle on the algorithmic approach [Franklin M. Liang developed in his 1983 PhD thesis.](https://tug.org/docs/liang/)
Raph Levien wrote a shorter explanation when Hunspell was [committed to Mozilla in 1998](https://github.com/hunspell/hyphen/blob/master/README.hyphen).*

This repository contains a compilation of [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io) hyphenation files that do not come included with installs of the [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/) apps.

*No spelling dictionaries are included in this repo, this is just hyphenation.*

### Sources
The source of these hyphenations files are
* https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries
* https://extensions.libreoffice.org/?q=hyphenation&action_doExtensionSearch=Search
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools/

The files have been converted to `UTF-8` before inclusion in this repository.

### Installing
To install these hyphenation files, copy them to `~/Library/Spelling/` and restart your Affinity apps.
