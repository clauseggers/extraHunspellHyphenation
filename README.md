### Extra hyphenation files for the Suite of MacOS Affinity applications*
\* and other MacOS applications that make use of `Hunspell` dictionaries.

This repository contains a compilation of hyphenation files that do not come included with installs of the Affinity apps.

The source of these hyphenations files is https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries

The files have been converted to `UTF-8` before inclusion in this repository.

To install these hypenation files, copy them to `~/Library/Spelling/` and restart your Affinity apps.
